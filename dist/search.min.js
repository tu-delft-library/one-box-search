Calculating the CiteScore is based on the number of citations to documents (articles, reviews, conference papers, book chapters, and data papers) by a journal over four years, divided by the number of the same document types indexed in Scopus and published in those same four years. It is calculated using data from Scopus, a database of abstracts and citations for peer-reviewed literature. CiteScore is a free metric that is available for all journals indexed in Scopus. SNIP is a metric that measures contextual citation impact by weighting citations based on the total number of citations in a subject field. The impact of a single citation is given higher value in subject areas where citations are less likely, and vice versa. SNIP allows for direct comparison between fields of research with different publication and citation practices. SJR is a metric based on the idea that not all citations are created equal. With SJR, the subject field, quality, and reputation of the journal have a direct effect on the value of a citation. SJR scores are computed using network analysis of citations received by journals.
